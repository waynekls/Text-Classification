Text Classification for Amazon Reviews

This Notebook begins with Exploratory Data Analysis of the Amazon Reviews to gain a basic understanding of the dataset.

We follow by splitting into Train and Test set and test using a simple pipeline of Tfidf and gridsearch to come up with the best parameters for classifying the reviews.

Models chosen for tuning are logistic regression and LinearSVM from the sklearn module.
